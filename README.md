- 👋 Hi, I’m Muuner, i have been an architect for about 5yrs and right now transitioning into becoming a programmer. Architecture has its pros and cons but programming seems to only stop where your imagination comes to a halt. This thereby creates a constant necessity for growth. 
- 👀 I’m interested in solving problems and building solutions that provides value to a wide range of audience and i think programming does this perfectly.
- 🌱 I’m 2-weeks old as a programmer, currently learning learning HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and REACT.
- 💞️ I’m looking to become a FRONT-END DEVELOPER in 3months, then build my way to being a full-stack further on. i'll be open to collaboration on projects that are 
      challenging but also valuable and cool*
